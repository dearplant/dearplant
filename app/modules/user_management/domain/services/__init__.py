User Management Domain Services

This package contains domain services that implement core business logic
for user management operations:

Domain Services:
- UserService: Core user lifecycle management and business operations
- AuthService: Authentication and authorization business logic
- ProfileService: Profile management and social features

Domain services orchestrate complex business operations that:
- Span multiple entities
- Require business rule validation
- Trigger domain events
- Coordinate with external services
- Implement business workflows

Each service follows domain-driven design principles:
- Encapsulates business logic
- Maintains domain model integrity
- Publishes domain events
- Validates business rules
- Coordinates with repositories
