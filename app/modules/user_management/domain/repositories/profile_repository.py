class ProfileRepository(ABC):
    """
    Repository interface for Profile entity data access operations.
    
    Defines the contract for Profile data persistence following the Repository pattern.
    Supports core doc Profile Management Submodule (1.2) functionality including:
    - Profile creation and editing
    - Photo upload management
    - Language and theme preferences
    - Location-based features
    - Privacy settings management
    
    Extended with social and community features:
    - Profile search and discovery
    - Social statistics tracking
    - Interest-based filtering
    - Privacy-aware data access
    
    Implementation Notes:
    - Concrete implementations are in infrastructure layer
    - Methods return domain entities (Profile), not database models
    - All operations are async for non-blocking I/O
    - Repository handles entity-to-model mapping
    - Respects privacy settings in query operations
