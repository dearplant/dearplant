User Management Domain Repositories

This package contains repository interfaces that define data access contracts
for user management entities:

Repository Interfaces:
- UserRepository: Data access interface for User entities
- ProfileRepository: Data access interface for Profile entities

Repository Pattern Benefits:
- Abstracts data access from business logic
- Enables dependency inversion (domain doesn't depend on infrastructure)
- Allows easy testing with mock implementations
- Supports multiple data storage backends
- Provides consistent data access patterns

Each repository interface:
- Defines CRUD operations for its entity
- Includes domain-specific query methods
- Returns domain entities (not database models)
- Uses async/await for non-blocking operations
- Follows consistent naming conventions

Implementation Note:
- These are interfaces/abstract classes only
- Concrete implementations are in infrastructure layer
- Domain services depend on these interfaces
- Infrastructure layer implements these interfaces
