User Management Domain Models

This package contains the core domain entities for user management:

Models:
- User: Core user entity with authentication data and basic profile info
- Profile: Extended user profile with preferences and social information  
- Subscription: User subscription and billing information

Each model follows domain-driven design principles:
- Rich domain models with business logic
- Validation rules enforced at domain level
- Immutable value objects where appropriate
- Domain events for state changes

Field specifications follow core doc requirements:
- UUID primary keys for all entities
- Timestamp fields with timezone support
- Email validation and uniqueness
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Status and role enumerations
