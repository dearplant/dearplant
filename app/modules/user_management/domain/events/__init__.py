User Management Domain Events

This package contains domain events for user lifecycle management:

Domain Events:
- UserCreated: Fired when a new user registers
- UserUpdated: Fired when user information changes
- UserDeleted: Fired when user account is deleted
- UserEmailVerified: Fired when user verifies their email
- UserPasswordChanged: Fired when user changes password
- UserSubscriptionChanged: Fired when subscription status changes
- UserProfileUpdated: Fired when profile information changes
- UserLoginSuccessful: Fired on successful login
- UserLoginFailed: Fired on failed login attempt

Event Handlers:
- User event processing and side effects
- Cross-module communication
- Notification triggering
- Analytics tracking

Events follow domain-driven design principles:
- Events are immutable
- Events contain all necessary data
- Events are published after domain state changes
- Events enable loose coupling between modules
