User Management Commands

This module contains all command definitions for user management operations
following the CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern.

Commands represent write operations and business use cases:
- CreateUserCommand: User registration and account creation
- UpdateProfileCommand: Profile information updates
- DeleteUserCommand: User account deletion and cleanup

All commands are immutable data structures that encapsulate
the parameters needed to perform business operations.
